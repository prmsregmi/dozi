## Local Development

Install dependencies:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
LIVEKIT_URL=wss://your-project.livekit.cloud
LIVEKIT_API_KEY=...
LIVEKIT_API_SECRET=...
```

Run locally:

```bash
python whisper_agent.py dev
```

## Deploy to LiveKit Cloud

Install LiveKit CLI:

```bash
brew install livekit-cli
```

Login and deploy:

```bash

cd agents/
lk agent create --project dozi
```

Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` in LiveKit Cloud dashboard under **Settings → Agents**.

LiveKit credentials are automatically provided by the platforms. The `livekit.toml` file is auto-generated by the LiveKit CLI and contains your credentials. It's gitignored for security.
